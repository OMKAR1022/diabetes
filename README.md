This project aims to predict diabetes outcomes using machine learning techniques and provides a user-friendly web interface for easy access to the prediction model. By utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a linear kernel, we've achieved an accuracy of 81.82% on the diabetes dataset.

Key Features

SVM Model: Trained an SVM model with a linear kernel to classify diabetes outcomes.
Web Interface: Developed a web interface using Streamlit to allow users to input patient data and receive real-time predictions.
Quick Insights: Users can get immediate insights into diabetes risk based on their inputs, without any technical expertise.

Web Interface

The heart of this project is the user-friendly web interface. With a clean and intuitive design, it's now easy for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess diabetes risk. By entering basic patient data such as age, BMI, glucose level, and more, users can get instant predictions and take proactive steps towards managing their health.
